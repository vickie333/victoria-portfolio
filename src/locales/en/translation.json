I combine database modeling in PostgreSQL, deployment automation with Docker and CI/CD flows, and best practices in testing and documentation to deliver maintainable solutions. I have implemented everything from text similarity algorithms and quantitative backtesting to custom Odoo modules, transforming business requirements into reliable and productive software. I work in remote environments with agile methodologies and collaborate closely with technical and functional teams."

		"text": "Passionate about software engineering and trained in Mathematics at the University of Havana, I bring 2 years of hands-on experience solving complex problems with Python. I have developed efficient RESTful APIs, optimized schemas and queries in PostgreSQL, and built automated pipelines for quantitative analysis (e.g., Crypto-Backtesting) and text processing (Text Similarity Finder). In addition, I designed and implemented custom modules in Odoo (London Project), integrated electronic invoicing and external APIs, and performed exploratory data analysis to extract actionable insights. I focus on clean code, testing, clear documentation, and reproducible deployments with Docker and CI/CD, always aligning the technical solution with business goals."
