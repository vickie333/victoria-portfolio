		"content": "I am a Fullstack developer specializing in Angular and TypeScript on the frontend and Python on the backend: I build scalable, accessible enterprise web interfaces, implement state management with NgRx, integrate with REST APIs, and create reusable components. On the backend I design and build robust RESTful APIs and data pipelines using Python and PostgreSQL, and automate deployments with Docker and CI/CD pipelines. I have experience migrating UIs, consolidating module architecture, and applying lazy loading to improve performance. I follow Clean Code and SOLID principles, write unit and end-to-end tests (Karma/Jest/Cypress for frontend; pytest for backend), and automate pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins for secure deployments. I work remotely with agile methodologies and collaborate closely with product and technical teams to turn requirements into reliable production software."

		"text": "Passionate about software engineering and holding a degree in Mathematics from the University of Havana, I bring over 2 years of practical experience in enterprise frontend development. I worked at companies such as Zup Innovation and KBA Air Filters, where I migrated and optimized Angular architectures, implemented NgRx for complex flows, and standardized API contracts and test suites—in addition to automating CI/CD pipelines. As a freelancer, I delivered full-stack applications with Docker deployments and automated pipelines, and produced technical documentation and API guides. My skills include Angular, TypeScript, NgRx/Redux, REST integration, SQL/PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, testing (Karma/Jest/Cypress), and best practices (Clean Code, SOLID). I focus on quality, maintainability, performance, and aligning deliverables with business objectives."
