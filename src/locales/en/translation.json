I have experience in UI migration, module architecture consolidation, and lazy loading to optimize performance. I apply Clean Code and SOLID principles, write unit and end-to-end tests (Karma/Jest/Cypress), and automate CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins for secure deployments. I work in remote environments using agile methodologies and collaborate closely with backend and product teams to transform requirements into reliable production software."

		"text": "Passionate about software engineering and holding a degree in Mathematics from the University of Havana, I bring over 2 years of practical experience in enterprise frontend development. I worked at companies such as Zup Innovation and KBA Air Filters, where I migrated and optimized Angular architectures, implemented NgRx for complex flows, and standardized API contracts and test suites—in addition to automating CI/CD pipelines. As a freelancer, I delivered full-stack applications with Docker deployments and automated pipelines, and produced technical documentation and API guides. My skills include Angular, TypeScript, NgRx/Redux, REST integration, SQL/PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, testing (Karma/Jest/Cypress), and best practices (Clean Code, SOLID). I focus on quality, maintainability, performance, and aligning deliverables with business objectives."
